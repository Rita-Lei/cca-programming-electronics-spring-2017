### Homework 9 (due Sunday, March 26)

This week's homework is to complete a practice quiz and put together a few possible ideas for your final project.

#### Practice Quiz

Download, print out, and complete this [practice quiz](practice-quiz.pdf). Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, take as long as you need (though be aware that we'll give you 2 hours in class), see what you can do without your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring. This is also a good opportunity for you to flesh out your notes if you're missing anything.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and [email it to us](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu,caroline.crandall@cca.edu) (don't put this in github) by Sunday night, 11:59pm on March 26.

#### Final Project

Your final project will take up the bulk of your classwork for the 2nd
half of term. Think about what you'd like to do, and [send
us](mailto:jzamfirescpereira@cca.edu,caroline.crandall@cca.edu) a 5-10 sentence
description of what you'd like to do by **Sunday night, March 26**. The
sooner you send us your thoughts, the sooner we can provide you with feedback and you can iterate. We'll probably go through a revision or two before you have a final idea to implement.

Here are some notes:

- Your project should have a significant programming component and electronic comonent.
- It should have some kind of input: maybe a sensor or two, a remote control, a touch control, a computer input -- perhaps through P5?
- It should have some kind of output: motors, LEDs, a P5 sketch on the web, sound, video playback, a graph of data, etc.
- It should have an artistic component.
- It could have a mechanical component.

Examples of pretty good projects include:

- Laser Light Dance Floor: a repurposed DDR pad that controls music playback and a laser light show.
- Lit Planters: a set of 3D-printed plants that respond to people walking around and interacting.
- Piano player: molded plastic fingers, connected to servo motors with strings, that pull the fingers down to play an electric keyboard. Reads the MIDI format and plays music!
- SensorBot: a wall-detecting robot that follows the walls in a room, measuring distance and light level as it goes.
- Wall Drawbot: a wall-mounted pen controlled by an Arduino that can draw an arbitrary drawing, perhaps from an SVG file.

Be creative! This is your chance to play with the concepts that excite you the most.

**As mentioned above, we will likely go through a bit of a
back-and-forth to refine your project idea -- the sooner you send it to us the more time you'll have to work on it!**
  
In class, you'll start to write a proposal for your final project. If you have questions about a particular component or concept, bring it or bring a prototype.
