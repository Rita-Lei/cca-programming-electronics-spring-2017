### Homework 3 (due Wednesday, February 15, 2017)

1. Complete the in-class exericses from Wednesday's class and submit them in your [homework repository](../github-guide.md) (label these sketches `sketch-1.js` etc.).

2. Complete this [code tracing exercise](https://github.com/zamfi/cca-programming-electronics-spring-2017/blob/master/hw/trace-exercise.pdf?raw=true), as though you are the computer, following the following instructions:
   1. For each new variable, add a new entry to the Computer Memory table.
   2. For every change in a variable's value, update the entry in the table, legibly crossing out the old value, like this update from 3 to 4:

      ![was 3, now 4](img/3-no-4.png)
   3. For every drawing command, draw the result on the canvas. (This exercise is all monochrome.)
   4. Tally (or draw a line or dot) to the left of each line as you evaluate it. (Some lines will be evaluated many times!)
   5. Scan & upload the printed exercise sheet to github (new repository for this assignment) and bring the original with you to class.


As a reminder, **please email us if you get stuck!** We are on email more than is probably healthy, and we are happy to answer questions. Also please make use of the help available to you at CCA: You can get hands-on, in-person help by stopping by the Hybrid Lab and speaking with a lab monitor, or by making an appointment with one of the [Software or Math/Science coaches at the Learning Resources Center](https://www.cca.edu/students/resources/appointments).

#### Tutorials for Review

We didn't get to this last week, so for next week, if you haven't already, please review:

Watch Daniel Shiffman's tutorials about [JavaScript objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e5h4IGKZRY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=7) and functions -- [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHAitGzBrg&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=16), [part s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkc417YapfE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=17), and [part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRnUBiTJ66Y&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=18).

Then, answer the following questions in a 'questions.md' file in your repository for week 3's homework:

1. What is one major advantage of using an object instead of multiple variables?

2. What is the role of the parameters of a function?

3. What does it mean for a function to "return" something?
